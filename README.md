# Dimensional ItemGate #

## About ##
Dimensional ItemGate allows pack developers to gate dimension access behind items in the inventory of the player. Craft custom gameplay experiences by controlling which items are prohibited or required for traversing into specific dimensions.

On its own the mod does not gate dimension access until a pack dev implements gating through gating recipes in a datapack.
